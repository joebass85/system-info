# system-info

This is a bash script that displays:
```
disc usage
memory usage
kernel release
active users on the system
and more
```
The CPU temperature only supports up to 4 compute cores. Also working to fix this.

The script `sys` works for Desktops and Laptops.
The script `sys-pi` works with the Raspberry Pi 3B (can only confirm for this model).
