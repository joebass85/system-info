# system-info
This is a bash script written to give text output of various things like disc usage, memory usage, kernel release, active users on the system, etc. The program currently only supports the export of up to 5 active users. Working to fix this in future updates. The CPU temperature only supports up to 4 compute cores. Also working to fix this.
